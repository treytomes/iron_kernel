# TODO

* Replace scroll bar button icons with arrow glyphs.
* When opening text editor or REPL, keyboard focus should be immediate.
* When opening a prompt, immediate keyboard focus on text box.
* When committing text on a prompt, accept and close the prompt.
* Mouse wheel should engage vertical scrollbar.
* In the text editor, source lines need to not wrap around to the next line.  It just doesn't look right.
